# **Blog Platform**

## **Project Description**
This project is a multi-user blogging platform built with **React** and **Vite**. It adopts a front-end and back-end decoupled architecture to support various features, including user registration, login, profile management, and article publishing and interaction. The primary goal of this project is to facilitate resource sharing and knowledge dissemination.

## **Technologies Used**
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.  
- **Ant Design**: A UI library for creating elegant and consistent interfaces.  
- **React-Router**: For routing and navigation in the application.  
- **React-Redux**: For managing application state.  
- **Fetch**: For asynchronous API requests.

## **Project Highlights**
- **Login State Synchronization**: Resolved issues where login status was not updated in real-time by optimizing React-Redux state synchronization mechanisms.  
- **Persistent User Settings**: Fixed issues with persistent storage of user information on the settings page.  
- **Lifecycle Management**: Improved component lifecycle management to ensure a stable user experience.  
- **Data Refresh Optimization**: Optimized the data refresh flow for the user’s personal homepage by leveraging React’s `useEffect` hook.
